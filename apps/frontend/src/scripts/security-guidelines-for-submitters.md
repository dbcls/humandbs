### Introduction

[The Database Center for Life Science (DBCLS) / the Joint Support-Center for Data Science Research (DS) of the Research Organization of Information and Systems (ROIS)](https://dbcls.rois.ac.jp/index-en.html) operates the NBDC Human Database in accordance with [the NBDC Guidelines for Human Data Sharing](/en/guidelines/data-sharing-guidelines) (hereinafter, the Data Sharing Guidelines). For data users, we have [the NBDC Security Guidelines for Human Data (for Data Users)](/en/guidelines/security-guidelines-for-users) (hereinafter, the Data User Security Guidelines). For data submitters, security measures that are stronger than those taken by data users are required because data submitters handle not only controlled-access data, which are defined in the Data Sharing Guidelines, but also data for future release (data held prior to publication of a paper or acquisition of a patent). Based on the Data User Security Guidelines, the “NBDC Security Guidelines for Human Data (for Data Submitters)” set forth the security measures to be taken by the data submitters.

### 1. Application of the User Security Guidelines

When controlled-access data or data for future release are handled, in principle the [standard-level (Type I) security measures](/en/guidelines/security-guidelines-for-users#typeI), which are listed in the Data User Security Guidelines, must be put in place, and the [high-level (Type II) security measures](/en/guidelines/security-guidelines-for-users#typeII) are implemented as needed. Data to be provided must be assigned codes or numbers that are unrelated to the individuals in lieu of all or part of the description or the like that may lead to identification of a particular individual (including one deceased) and further assigned another set of codes or numbers.

Some definitions in the [section 1 (Definitions)](/en/guidelines/security-guidelines-for-users#yougo) of the Data User Security Guidelines are changed as follows, and the sections starting with the section 2 (Measures to Be Taken under Standard-Level (Type I) Security) are applied to this document.

- 3. Data user
  - The PI or a person who accesses data under supervision of the PI.
